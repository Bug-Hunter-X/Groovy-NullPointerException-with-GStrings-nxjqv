This example demonstrates a subtle NullPointerException that can occur in Groovy when dealing with GStrings and null checks.  The issue arises when a null value is passed to a method that performs arithmetic or string concatenation involving GStrings. This is because the Groovy runtime tries to evaluate the GString's expression even when the variable is null. This can be tricky to identify because the initial null check appears to prevent the issue. The solution shows how to address this problem.
